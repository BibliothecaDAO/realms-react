## _Pick a Wonder, build it with briqs, displayed on Oasis._

#### **what is a wonder?**

Wonders are mythical structures, both man-made and naturally formed, scattered throughout the Realmverse.

While they have been admired and worshipped for eons, their true beauty and image have never been transcribed to share with the wider world.

This is where you come in.

We are calling on all builders, artists and layer 2 trailblazers to create their own visual representation of these sacred sites with briqs, directly on StarkNet.

Of the 50 Wonders, there will be 16 to choose from to build: one from each of the Orders.

All creations will be displayed on Oasis in a special Realms category for all to see and worship.

The winner from each unique Wonder, voted on by the community, will receive 3000x $LORDS - a total of 48k in prizes.

There are no prerequisites; everyone is welcome to participate. You can submit as many as you like and, if voted by the community, can win multiple across the different Wonders of the Orders.
