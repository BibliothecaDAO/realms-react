      'The order of Reflection thrives off of time spent with their own thoughts, believing that interaction with an everchanging Realm dulls their ability to see the ethereal. They’re most often found searching for insights into the past and the future by isolating themselves in the darkness. There are rumors of disturbing rituals to aid in conjuring the visions they seek, and their trade in the less savoury markets banned in some Realms does nothing to dispel these rumors.',
